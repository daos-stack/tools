# tools
Tools used for optional testing of projects.

This is used to fetch and build tools for optional testing
of projects.

On a jenkins system, it will produce artifacts with the tools.

## bullseye

The current Bullseye tarball for Linux is downloaded and cached as a Jekins artifact.  It will need a license key
from Bullseye to use.

## bullshtml

This downloads the master branch of what appears to be the
most current fork of the bullshtml project and builds
a jar that is cached as a Jenkins artifact.
